Our world is changing all the time. Some change is fast, some change is slow, and all change looks different across the world. Wielded appropriately, this change can be an awesome tool for learning more about our environment and our health.

I'm most interested in changes in our air quality---air pollution causes millions of deaths each year world-wide. Many countries have implemented regulations to curb this burden, and we can study these regulations using the Air Pollution Accountability Chain.

{{< figure library="true" src="AccountabilityChain.png" title="Air Pollution Accountability Chain" lightbox="true" >}}

This framework describes how regulations impact emissions, air quality, personal dose/exposure, and ultimately public health. Though we can make measurements at each of these links, the relationships that are most informative for policymakers (blue portions of the arrows) are clouded by other factors (red portions). 

I'm building a multi-disciplinary team that will advance research along the Air Pollution Accountability Chain. We'll develop models and devise new analytical techniques to create evidence for continued improvements in envornmental policy at scales local to global. If you're a prospective graduate student with strong analytical skills, please review my [ongoing projects](#projects) and [recent papers](https://www.lucashenneman.org/publication/) and reach out.
