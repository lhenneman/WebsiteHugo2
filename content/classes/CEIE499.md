This class will explore the physical and chemical processes that dictate the Earthâ€™s climate along with human actions and natural dynamics that lead to climate change. Problem sets and readings will cover observed and projected impacts on natural and engineered systems. Students will understand proposed and enacted climate policy.

## Course objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
 - Describe climate change and perform relevant calculations related to why it is occurring and how we know it is occurring
 -  Describe observed and predicted impacts of climate change on engineered systems and perform relevant calculations
 - Describe proposed and enacted climate policy and perform relevant calculations
