For this course, I worked with a team of Harvard Chan School postdocs to craft an introduction to public health. In the first session (Part 1 slides [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9s5c1tvo76d86xj/PublicHealth101-S1P1.pdf?dl=0), Part 2 [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cx2ea4phgnxnepi/PublicHealth101-S1P2.pdf?dl=0)), we introduced different definitions of health and public health. Building on these definitions, we presented a conceptual framework for thinking about public health challenges and the resulting response. These concepts were further explored through a case study on the coordination of the Liberian response during the recent Ebola epidemic. Participants were introduced to the various tools of public health and how they relate to programs and departments at HSPH.  

In the second session (slides [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vmz6qqw4aaub5am/PublicHealth101-S2.pdf?dl=0)), we dug deeper into two components of the Liberian Ebola response (epidemiological surveillance and community engagement).
