CEIE 450/550 Environmental Engineering Systems introduces the concepts and applications of systems analysis in environmental engineering. Tools and methodologies of systems analysis are applied to improve the understanding and resolution of complex environmental engineering problems related to air, soil, and water quality and pollution. Scientific, engineering, political, social, legal, regulatory, medical, economic, and financial impacts of environmental engineering decisions are considered. 

## Course objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
 - Define environmental engineering systems
 - Assess tools and methods used in the analysis and resolution of environmental engineering systems problems
 - Apply these approaches to a variety of environmental challenges
