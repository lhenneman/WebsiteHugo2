This project, funded by the NIH and begun in 2021, leverages the recently completed data linkage between the 1940 census and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Our overall objective is to evaluate effects of early-life community-level social and environmental factors on late-life Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and the extent to which these factors contribute to racial disparities on ADRD. 

At GMU, our role is to quantify source-specific air pollution exposures for study locations in 1940.
