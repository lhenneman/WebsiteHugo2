abstract: On-road emissions sources degrade air quality, and these sources have been
  highly regulated. Epidemiological and environmental justice studies often use road
  proximity as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure, and other
  studies employ air quality models or satellite observations. To assess these metrics'
  abilities to reproduce observed near-road concentration gradients and changes over
  time, we apply a hierarchical linear regression to ground-based observations, long-term
  air quality model simulations using Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), and
  satellite products. Across 1980−2019, observed TRAP concentrations decreased, and
  road proximity was positively correlated with TRAP. For all pollutants, concentrations
  decreased fastest at locations with higher road proximity, resulting in \"flatter\"
  concentration fields in recent years. This flattening unfolded at a relatively constant
  rate for NO x , whereas the flattening of CO concentration fields has slowed. CMAQ
  largely captures observed spatial−temporal NO 2 trends across 2002−2010 but overstates
  the relationships between CO and elemental carbon fine particulate matter (EC) road
  proximity. Satellite NO x measures overstate concentration reductions near roads.
  We show how this perspective provides evidence that California's on-road vehicle
  regulations led to substantial decreases in NO 2 , NO x , and EC in California,
  with other states that adopted California's light-duty automobile standards showing
  mixed benefits over states that did not adopt these standards. ■ INTRODUCTION On-road
  mobile source emissions have been shown to have large impacts on air pollution,
  human exposure, and environmental health. 1−3 Documenting spatial and temporal variability
  in pollution from on-road sources (often called traffic-related air pollution, TRAP)
  informs epidemiological and environmental justice (EJ) studies of automobile contributions
  to adverse health outcomes and inequality. 4−7 In addition, identifying emissions
  and exposure trends over long periods is important for estimating benefits of regulatory
  programs and projecting impacts of future air pollution policies. 8,9 Tracking source-specific
  spatial−temporal trends has the potential to improve evaluations of broad regulations
  implemented on different sources congruently over long periods. 10,11 Research has
  shown that the emissions mix from the United States vehicle fleet has evolved over
  recent decades, 12 and studies have revealed multidecadal reductions in air pollution
  mixture differences between near-and far-road environments. 13−15 These differences
  will likely continue to shrink with increased electrification and as the current
  fleet turns over to newer vehicles certified to the EPA's Tier 3 program beginning
  with 2017 model year vehicles. 16,17 Even with reduced impact of road travel broadly,
  however, mobile air quality monitoring continues to show elevated air pollution
  concentrations in the near-road environment 18 (some of which is due to growing
  relative importance of stationary sources in urban areas, e.g., restaurants 19),
  and recent research has identified continued ecological and health impacts imparted
  by mobile sources. 20−22 The ability of exposure assessment tools such as air quality
  models, satellite measurements, and distance-based metrics to capture observed air
  pollution trends in space and time are important for these tools' expanded viability
  in health studies and policy evaluations. 23 There is evidence derived from such
  tools that United States mobile source nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions estimates
  may be biased high by as much as a factor of two. 2,24−28 Juxtaposed with these
  findings of bias, however, multiple studies have concluded that modeled emissions
  capture air pollutant trends accurately enough for air quality models to provide
  adequate estimates of air quality and changes over time. 4,29−35 For some model
  applications (such as regulatory accountability studies and/or epidemiological studies),
  capturing spatial and/or temporal trends in emissions changes is more important
  than accurately capturing absolute emissions.
