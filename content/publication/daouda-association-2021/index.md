abstract: Coal has historically been a primary energy source in the United States
  (U.S.). The byproducts of coal combustion, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5),
  have increasingly been associated with adverse birth outcomes. The goal of this
  study was to leverage the current progressive transition away from coal in the U.S.
  to assess whether coal PM2.5 is associated with preterm birth (PTB) rates and whether
  this association differs by maternal Black/White race/ethnicity. Using a novel dispersion
  modeling approach, we estimated PM2.5 pollution from coal-fired power plants nationwide
  at the county-level during the study period (2000–2018). We also obtained county-level
  PTB rates for non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black mothers. We used a generalized
  additive mixed model to estimate the relationship between coal PM2.5 and PTB rates,
  overall and stratified by maternal race. We included a natural spline to allow for
  non-linearity in the concentration–response curve. We observed a positive non-linear
  relationship between coal PM2.5 and PTB rate, which plateaued at higher levels of
  pollution. We also observed differential associations by maternal race; the association
  was stronger for White women, especially at higher levels of coal PM2.5 (textgreater2.0
  μg m−3). Our findings suggest that the transition away from coal may reduce PTB
  rates in the U.S.
