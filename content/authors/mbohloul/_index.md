I am a PhD student in Environmental Engineering with experience in emissions quantification, analysis, and air dispersion modeling. I focus on air quality modeling, pollution control, and environmental impact assessment. My research uses models and analytical methods to address air pollution, aiming to protect communities from harmful pollutants and improve environmental policies. With a background in chemical engineering and expertise in air dispersion models, I apply engineering principles, data science, and hands-on experience to quantify emissions from industries such as power generation and oil and gas.
