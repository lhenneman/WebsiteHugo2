Hello, I am a PhD student who is in passion with air quality modeling research. My current project is to evaluate the effects of early-life community-level social and environmental factors on late-life ADRD and the extent to which these factors con- tribute to racial disparities on ADRD in a nationally representative sample. In this project, our team focuses on modeling historical air quality in the United States to produce historical exposure estimates for epidemiological research.
