I am a PhD student majoring in Environmental Engineering with the experience addressing real-world environmental issues through emissions quantification, analysis, and modeling. My strong interest in the environment and sustainability has led me to focus on air quality modeling, air pollution control and environmental impact analysis. During my advanced education, I conduct research on developing models and devising new analytical methods for air pollution modeling with the aim of protecting communities from toxic pollution and improving environmental policy. My background in chemical engineering helps me to combine engineering principles, data science, and practical experience to quantify emissions from transportation, power generation, and chemical manufacturing activities.
