Hi! I am an Environmental Engineer dedicated to improving our understanding of the complex interactions between human activity and the environment, and exploring ways to address the many challenges facing our planet today. My research area of air pollution regulatory accountability and environmental injustice is particularly important as it seeks to uncover the root causes of environmental disparities and injustices consequently promoting environmental equity. As a PhD student, I am committed to conducting rigorous research, engaging with stakeholders and communities, and translating my findings into actionable recommendations for policymakers and practitioners. Through my work, I aim to help building a more sustainable, just, and resilient future for all. If you have any questions or recommendations, feel free to reach out!
