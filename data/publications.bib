This study examines the effects of reduced emissions on the trend of aerosol acidity in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), at a nationwide scale, using ambient concentration data from three monitoring networks–the Ammonia Monitoring Network (AMoN), the Clean Air Status and Trends network (CASTNET) and the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization Network (SEARCH), in conjunction with thermodynamic (ISORROPIA-II) and chemical transport (CMAQ) model results.

	abstract = {In China, rural migrant workers (RMWs) are employed in urban workplaces but receive minimal resources and welfare. Their residential energy use mix (REM) and pollutant emission profiles are different from those of traditional urban (URs) and rural residents (RRs). Their migration towards urban areas plays an important role in shaping the magnitudes and spatial patterns of pollutant emissions, ambient PM2.5(fine particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 μm) concentrations, and associated health impacts in both urban and rural areas. Here we evaluate the impacts of RMW migration on REM pollutant emissions, ambient PM2.5, and subsequent premature deaths across China. At the national scale, RMW migration benefits ambient air quality because RMWs tend to transition to a cleaner REM upon arrival at urban areas—though not as clean as urban residents'. In 2010, RMW migration led to a decrease of 1.5 μg/m3in ambient PM2.5exposure concentrations (Cex) averaged across China and a subsequent decrease of 12,200 (5700 to 16,300, as 90\% confidence interval) in premature deaths from exposure to ambient PM2.5. Despite the overall health benefit, large-scale cross-province migration increased megacities' PM2.5levels by as much as 10 μg/m3due to massive RMW inflows. Model simulations show that upgrading within-city RMWs' REMs can effectively offset the RMW-induced PM2.5increase in megacities, and that policies that properly navigate migration directions may have potential for balancing the economic growth against ambient air quality deterioration. Our study indicates the urgency of considering air pollution impacts into migration-related policy formation in the context of rapid urbanization in China.},

	abstract = {One major source of uncertainty in accurately estimating human exposure to air pollution is that human subjects move spatiotemporally, and such mobility is usually not considered in exposure estimation. How such mobility impacts exposure estimates at the population and individual level, particularly for subjects with different levels of mobility, remains under-investigated. In addition, a wide range of methods have been used in the past to develop air pollutant concentration fields for related health studies. How the choices of methods impact results of exposure estimation, especially when detailed mobility information is considered, is still largely unknown. In this study, by using a publicly available large cell phone location dataset containing over 35 million location records collected from 310,989 subjects, we investigated the impact of individual subjects’ mobility on their estimated exposures for five chosen ambient pollutants (CO, NO2, SO2, O3 and PM2.5). We also estimated exposures separately for 10 groups of subjects with different levels of mobility to explore how increased mobility impacted their exposure estimates. Further, we applied and compared two methods to develop concentration fields for exposure estimation, including one based on Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model outputs, and the other based on the interpolated observed pollutant concentrations using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method. Our results suggest that detailed mobility information does not have a significant influence on mean population exposure estimate in our sample population, although impacts can be substantial at the individual level. Additionally, exposure classification error due to the use of home-location data increased for subjects that exhibited higher levels of mobility. Omitting mobility could result in underestimation of exposures to traffic-related pollutants particularly during afternoon rush-hour, and overestimate exposures to ozone especially during mid-afternoon. Between CMAQ and IDW, we found that the IDW method generates smooth concentration fields that were not suitable for exposure estimation with detailed mobility data. Therefore, the method for developing air pollution concentration fields when detailed mobility data were to be applied should be chosen carefully. Our findings have important implications for future air pollution health studies.},

	abstract = {© 2019 American Chemical Society. Understanding quantitative relationships between ambient ozone concentrations and precursor emissions is important to policymakers and stakeholders. Such relationships are often captured as ozone isopleth diagrams developed using air quality models. Model-based approaches have limitations, including errors stemming from uncertainties in inputs and modeled processes, and can be computationally burdensome. We develop and apply an empirical method based on ozone design values calculated in the South Coast Air Basin, California, for 1975-2016 to construct ozone isopleths. The study domain is the area with the highest ozone levels in the United States that has experienced high levels of emissions control. Quadratic and log-quadratic models were constructed, and both capture the actual observations very well (R2 ∼0.98) and re-create the general characteristics of traditional air quality model-generated isopleths. The empirical approach benefits from being based on observations that are highly accurate (but have a low spatial coverage). Analysis shows that uncertainties are {\textless}30\% near likely future control levels. Furthermore, the method shows that the nitrogen oxide (NOx)-volatile organic compound (VOC)-ozone system in the 1970s was in the region where VOC controls were most effective and then more recently moved to the region where both VOC and NOx controls are effective.},

	abstract = {© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Appropriately characterizing spatiotemporal individual mobility is important in many research areas, including epidemiological studies focusing on air pollution. However, in many retrospective air pollution health studies, exposure to air pollution is typically estimated at the subjects’ residential addresses. Individual mobility is often neglected due to lack of data, and exposure misclassification errors are expected. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of using location history data collected from smartphones by the Google Maps application for characterizing historical individual mobility and exposure. Here, one subject carried a smartphone installed with Google Maps, and a reference GPS data logger which was configured to record location every 10 s, for a period of one week. The retrieved Google Maps Location History (GMLH) data were then compared with the GPS data to evaluate their effectiveness and accuracy of the GMLH data to capture individual mobility. We also conducted an online survey (n = 284) to assess the availability of GMLH data among smartphone users in the US. We found the GMLH data reasonably captured the spatial movement of the subject during the one-week time period at up to 200 m resolution. We were able to accurately estimate the time the subject spent in different microenvironments, as well as the time the subject spent driving during the week. The estimated time-weighted daily exposures to ambient particulate matter using GMLH and the GPS data logger were also similar (error less than 1.2\%). Survey results showed that GMLH data may be available for 61\% of the survey sample. Considering the popularity of smartphones and the Google Maps application, detailed historical location data are expected to be available for large portion of the population, and results from this study highlight the potential of these location history data to improve exposure estimation for retrospective epidemiological studies. Google Maps location history data captured the subject's mobility during the study period, suggesting such data has great potential to be used to improve air pollution exposure estimation.},

	abstract = {On-road emissions sources degrade air quality, and these sources have been highly regulated. Epidemiological and environmental justice studies often use road proximity as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure, and other studies employ air quality models or satellite observations. To assess these metrics' abilities to reproduce observed near-road concentration gradients and changes over time, we apply a hierarchical linear regression to ground-based observations, long-term air quality model simulations using Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), and satellite products. Across 1980−2019, observed TRAP concentrations decreased, and road proximity was positively correlated with TRAP. For all pollutants, concentrations decreased fastest at locations with higher road proximity, resulting in "flatter" concentration fields in recent years. This flattening unfolded at a relatively constant rate for NO x , whereas the flattening of CO concentration fields has slowed. CMAQ largely captures observed spatial−temporal NO 2 trends across 2002−2010 but overstates the relationships between CO and elemental carbon fine particulate matter (EC) road proximity. Satellite NO x measures overstate concentration reductions near roads. We show how this perspective provides evidence that California's on-road vehicle regulations led to substantial decreases in NO 2 , NO x , and EC in California, with other states that adopted California's light-duty automobile standards showing mixed benefits over states that did not adopt these standards. ■ INTRODUCTION On-road mobile source emissions have been shown to have large impacts on air pollution, human exposure, and environmental health. 1−3 Documenting spatial and temporal variability in pollution from on-road sources (often called traffic-related air pollution, TRAP) informs epidemiological and environmental justice (EJ) studies of automobile contributions to adverse health outcomes and inequality. 4−7 In addition, identifying emissions and exposure trends over long periods is important for estimating benefits of regulatory programs and projecting impacts of future air pollution policies. 8,9 Tracking source-specific spatial−temporal trends has the potential to improve evaluations of broad regulations implemented on different sources congruently over long periods. 10,11 Research has shown that the emissions mix from the United States vehicle fleet has evolved over recent decades, 12 and studies have revealed multidecadal reductions in air pollution mixture differences between near-and far-road environments. 13−15 These differences will likely continue to shrink with increased electrification and as the current fleet turns over to newer vehicles certified to the EPA's Tier 3 program beginning with 2017 model year vehicles. 16,17 Even with reduced impact of road travel broadly, however, mobile air quality monitoring continues to show elevated air pollution concentrations in the near-road environment 18 (some of which is due to growing relative importance of stationary sources in urban areas, e.g., restaurants 19), and recent research has identified continued ecological and health impacts imparted by mobile sources. 20−22 The ability of exposure assessment tools such as air quality models, satellite measurements, and distance-based metrics to capture observed air pollution trends in space and time are important for these tools' expanded viability in health studies and policy evaluations. 23 There is evidence derived from such tools that United States mobile source nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions estimates may be biased high by as much as a factor of two. 2,24−28 Juxtaposed with these findings of bias, however, multiple studies have concluded that modeled emissions capture air pollutant trends accurately enough for air quality models to provide adequate estimates of air quality and changes over time. 4,29−35 For some model applications (such as regulatory accountability studies and/or epidemiological studies), capturing spatial and/or temporal trends in emissions changes is more important than accurately capturing absolute emissions. 10},

	abstract = {© 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020. Marginal structural models (MSM) with inverse probability weighting (IPW) are used to estimate causal effects of time-varying treatments, but can result in erratic finite-sample performance when there is low overlap in covariate distributions across different treatment patterns. Modifications to IPW which target the average treatment effect (ATE) estimand either introduce bias or rely on unverifiable parametric assumptions and extrapolation. This paper extends an alternate estimand, the ATE on the overlap population (ATO) which is estimated on a sub-population with a reasonable probability of receiving alternate treatment patterns in time-varying treatment settings. To estimate the ATO within an MSM framework, this paper extends a stochastic pruning method based on the posterior predictive treatment assignment (PPTA) (Zigler, C. M., and M. Cefalu. 2017. "Posterior Predictive Treatment Assignment for Estimating Causal Effects with Limited Overlap."eprint arXiv:1710.08749.) as well as a weighting analog (Li, F., K. L. Morgan, and A. M.

Simulations demonstrate the performance of these extensions compared against IPW and stabilized weighting with regard to bias, efficiency, and coverage.

Chemical transport models (CTMs) remain the most complete representation of atmospheric processes but are limited in applications that require large numbers of runs, such as those that evaluate individual impacts from large numbers of sources. This limitation motivates comparisons between modern CTM-derived techniques and intentionally simpler alternatives. We model population-weighted PM2.5 source impacts from each of greater than 1100 coal power plants operating in the United States in 2006 and 2011 using three approaches: (1) adjoint PM2.5 sensitivities calculated by the GEOS-Chem CTM; (2) a wind field-based Lagrangian model called HyADS; and (3) a simple calculation based on emissions and inverse source-receptor distance. Annual individual power plants’ nationwide population-weighted PM2.5 source impacts calculated by HyADS and the inverse distance approach have normalized mean errors between 20 and 28\% and root mean square error ranges between 0.0003 and 0.0005 µg m−3 compared with adjoint sensitivities. Reduced complexity approaches are most similar to the GEOS-Chem adjoint sensitivities nearby and downwind of sources, with degrading performance farther from and upwind of sources particularly when wind fields are not accounted for.},

	abstract = {Coal burning power plants are a frequent target of regulatory programmes because of their emission of chemicals that are known precursors to the formation of ambient particulate air pollution. Health impact assessments of emissions from coal power plants typically rely on assumed causal relationships between emissions, ambient pollution and health, many of which have never been empirically verified. We offer a novel statistical evaluation of some of these presumed causal relationships, integrating the formality of causal inference methods with repurposed tools from atmospheric science to accommodate the central challenge of long-range pollution transport of emissions from power plants to exposed populations. The statistical approach follows recent work on Bayesian methods for deploying principal stratification and causal mediation analysis in tandem to characterize the extent to which decreased sulphur dioxide emissions from 410 power plants across the USA impact mortality and hospitalization outcomes across Medicare beneficiaries residing across 12370 locations in a manner that is mediated through reductions of ambient fine particulate pollution. The result is the first epidemiological investigation integrating causal inference methodology with direct measurements of coal emissions, pollution transport, ambient pollution and human health in a single analysis, indicating the potential for data science at the intersection of statistics, epidemiology and atmospheric science.},

Specifically, we introduce the HYSPLIT average dispersion model, HyADS, which combines the HYSPLIT trajectory dispersion model with modern advances in parallel computing to estimate ZIP code level exposure to emissions from individual coal-powered electricity generating units in the United States. Importantly, the method is not designed to reproduce ambient concentrations of any particular air pollutant; rather, the primary goal is to characterize each ZIP code's exposure to these coal power plants specifically. We show adequate performance towards this goal against observed annual average air pollutant concentrations (nationwide Pearson correlations of 0.88 and 0.73 with SO 42− and PM 2.5 , respectively) and coal-combustion impacts simulated with a full-scale chemical transport model and adjusted to observations using a hybrid direct sensitivities approach (correlation of 0.90). We proceed to provide multiple examples of HyADS's single-source applicability, including to show that 22\% of the population-weighted coal exposure comes from 30 coal-powered electricity generating units.},

	abstract = {AbstractAssessments of past environmental policies?termed accountability studies?contribute important information to the decision-making process used to review the efficacy of past policies, and subsequently aid in the development of effective new policies. These studies have used a variety of methods that have achieved varying levels of success at linking improvements in air quality and/or health to regulations. The Health Effects Institute defines the air pollution accountability framework as a chain of events that includes the regulation of interest, air quality, exposure/dose, and health outcomes, and suggests that accountability research should address impacts for each of these linkages. Early accountability studies investigated short-term, local regulatory actions (for example, coal use banned city-wide on a specific date or traffic pattern changes made for Olympic games). Recent studies assessed regulations implemented over longer time and larger spatial scales. Studies on broader scales require accountability research methods that account for effects of confounding factors that increase over time and space. Improved estimates of appropriate baseline levels (sometimes termed ?counterfactual??the expected state in a scenario without an intervention) that account for confounders and uncertainties at each link in the accountability chain will help estimate causality with greater certainty. In the direct accountability framework, researchers link outcomes with regulations using statistical methods that bypass the link-by-link approach of classical accountability. Direct accountability results and methods complement the classical approach. New studies should take advantage of advanced planning for accountability studies, new data sources (such as satellite measurements), and new statistical methods. Evaluation of new methods and data sources is necessary to improve investigations of long-term regulations, and associated uncertainty should be accounted for at each link to provide a confidence estimate of air quality regulation effectiveness. The final step in any accountability is the comparison of results with the proposed benefits of an air quality policy.Implications: The field of air pollution accountability continues to grow in importance to a number of stakeholders. Two frameworks, the classical accountability chain and direct accountability, have been used to estimate impacts of regulatory actions, and both require careful attention to confounders and uncertainties. Researchers should continue to be develop and evaluate both methods as they investigate current and future air pollution regulations.},

Background: National, state, and local policies contributed to a 65\% reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants between 2005 and 2012 in the United States, providing an opportunity to directly quantify public health benefits attributable to these reductions under an air pollution accountability framework. Methods: We estimate ZIP code-level changes in two different-but related-exposure metrics: total PM2.5 concentrations and exposure to coal-fired power plant emissions. We associate changes in 10 health outcome rates among approximately 30 million US Medicare beneficiaries with exposure changes between 2005 and 2012 using two difference-in-difference regression approaches designed to mitigate observed and unobserved confounding. Results: Rates per 10,000 person-years of six cardiac and respiratory health outcomes-all cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, cardiovascular stroke, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and respiratory tract infections-decreased by between 7.89 and 1.95 per decrease in PM2.5, with comparable decreases in coal exposure leading to slightly larger rate decreases. Results for acute myocardial infarction, heart rhythm disorders, and peripheral vascular disease were near zero and/or mixed between the various exposure metrics and analyses. A secondary analysis found that nonlinearities in relationships between changing health outcome rates and coal exposure may explain differences in their associations. Conclusions: The direct analyses of emissions reductions estimate substantial health benefits via coal power plant emission and PM2.5 concentration reductions. Differing responses associated with changes in the two exposure metrics underscore the importance of isolating source-specific impacts from those due to total PM2.5 exposure.},

Objectives: As part of a comprehensive air pollution accountability study, we used a counterfactual study design to estimate the impact of mobile source and electricity generation control policies on health outcomes in the Atlanta, GA, metropolitan area from 1999 to 2013. Methods: We identified nine sets of pollution control policies, estimated changes in emissions in the absence of these policies, and employed those changes to estimate counterfactual daily ambient pollutant concentrations at a central monitoring location. Using a multipollutant Poisson time-series model, we estimated associations between observed pollutant levels and daily counts of cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits at Atlanta hospitals. These associations were then used to estimate the number of ED visits prevented due to control policies, comparing observed to counterfactual daily concentrations. Results: Pollution control policies were estimated to substantially reduce ambient concentrations of the nine pollutants examined for the period 1999–2013. We estimated that pollutant concentration reductions resulting from the control policies led to the avoidance of over 55,000 cardiorespiratory disease ED visits in the five-county metropolitan Atlanta area, with greater proportions of visits prevented in later years as effects of policies became more fully realized. During the final two years of the study period, 2012–2013, the policies were estimated to prevent 16.5\% of ED visits due to asthma (95\% interval estimate: 7.5\%, 25.1\%), 5.9\% (95\% interval estimate: −0.4\%, 12.3\%) of respiratory ED visits, and 2.3\% (95\% interval estimate: −1.8\%, 6.2\%) of cardiovascular disease ED visits. Discussion: Pollution control policies resulting from the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments led to substantial estimated reductions in ambient pollutant concentrations and cardiorespiratory ED visits in the Atlanta area.},

Recent research years has attributed reduced emissions over the past two decades to regulations enacted under these Amendments, but none have separated long-term daily impacts of individual regulatory programs on multiple source categories under a consistent framework. Using daily emissions and air quality measurements along with a detailed review of national and local regulations promulgated after the Amendments, we quantify daily changes in emissions and air quality attributable to regulations on electricity generating units and on-road mobile sources. To quantify daily changes, we develop nine sets of counterfactual emissions and ambient air pollution concentration time series for 10 pollutants that assume individual regulatory programs and combinations thereof were not implemented. In addition to daily impacts, we estimate uncertainties in these results. These counterfactual daily ambient concentrations reveal high seasonality and increasing effectiveness of most regulations between 1999 and 2013. Monthly average counterfactual concentrations in scenarios that assume no new regulations on electricity generating units and mobile sources are greater than observed concentrations for all pollutants except ozone, which has seen increased wintertime concentrations accompany summertime decreases. By the end of the period, electricity generating unit emissions reductions under the Acid Rain Program and Clean Air Interstate Rule and their respective related local programs led to similar PM2.5 concentration decreases. Of the mobile source regulations, rules on gasoline and diesel vehicles led to similar reductions in annual PM2.5, and gasoline programs led to double the summertime ozone reductions as diesel programs. The nine sets of daily time series and their uncertainties were designed for use in air pollution accountability health studies.},

	abstract = {Coal has historically been a primary energy source in the United States (U.S.). The byproducts of coal combustion, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), have increasingly been associated with adverse birth outcomes. The goal of this study was to leverage the current progressive transition away from coal in the U.S. to assess whether coal PM2.5 is associated with preterm birth (PTB) rates and whether this association differs by maternal Black/White race/ethnicity. Using a novel dispersion modeling approach, we estimated PM2.5 pollution from coal-fired power plants nationwide at the county-level during the study period (2000–2018). We also obtained county-level PTB rates for non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black mothers. We used a generalized additive mixed model to estimate the relationship between coal PM2.5 and PTB rates, overall and stratified by maternal race. We included a natural spline to allow for non-linearity in the concentration–response curve. We observed a positive non-linear relationship between coal PM2.5 and PTB rate, which plateaued at higher levels of pollution. We also observed differential associations by maternal race; the association was stronger for White women, especially at higher levels of coal PM2.5 ({\textgreater}2.0 μg m−3). Our findings suggest that the transition away from coal may reduce PTB rates in the U.S.},

	abstract = {Understanding how individual pollution sources contribute to ambient sulfate pollution is critical for assessing past and future air quality regulations. Since attribution to specific sources is typically not encoded in spatial air pollution data, we develop a mechanistic model which we use to estimate, with uncertainty, the contribution of ambient sulfate concentrations attributable specifically to sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from individual coal-fired power plants in the central United States. We propose a multivariate Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process approximation to the dynamics of the underlying space-time chemical transport process, and its distributional properties are leveraged to specify novel probability models for spatial data that are viewed as either a snapshot or time-averaged observation of the OU process. Using US EPA SO2 emissions data from 193 power plants and state-of-the-art estimates of ground-level annual mean sulfate concentrations, we estimate that in 2011—a time of active power plant regulatory action—existing flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) technologies at 66 power plants reduced population-weighted exposure to ambient sulfate by 1.97 μg/m3 (95\% CI: 1.80–2.15). Furthermore, we anticipate future regulatory benefits by estimating that installing FGD technologies at the five largest SO2-emitting facilities would reduce human exposure to ambient sulfate by an additional 0.45 μg/m3 (95\% CI: 0.33–0.54).
